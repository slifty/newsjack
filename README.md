This project was built from Mozilla's Hackasaurus, which you can find by looking at the forks.

## INSTALLING
If you are only interested in hosting an instance of NewsJack then you only need the contents of the static-files directory.

1) Plop those into a web server that runs PHP
2) cd to the directory you set up
3) cp config.default.php
4) vi config.default.php
5) php install.php

And with that you should be all set.  Send any questions to info@newsjack.in

If you are interested in helping to code then for now you have to do some inspection on your own / ask me questions.  We'll have a better community set up eventually.
